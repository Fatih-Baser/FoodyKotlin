# Foody

Our application will work with both Remote and local data sources. And for Remote data source we will use a third party API for food recipes, called Spoonacular. I'm going to teach you how to establish connection between your app and the server. So basically we will send GET Request to our API and receive a list of food recipes as a Response. Also our app will be able to handle no internet connection, and store or cache the data localy to our database when it's needed.

Also from our application we will be able to search recipes from our API directly. So if you have your favorite flavor you can search it here and probably you'll find many amazing recipes. Next our app will have Favorites Fragment where we can save our favorite recipes for later use when we need them. And finally our app will have it's fun side, and that is food joke fragment.
